## Hello everyone, I am Tatenda Shoko

I have a background in Financial Mathematics, and I recently graduated with a  Master's degree in Mathematical Sciences from the University of Cape Town under AIMS South Africa. The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences wholly sponsored my studies. 

My interests lie in the fundamental mathematics of Machine Learning. I am deeply curious about understanding concepts in depth. Additionally, I am interested in applying machine and Deep Learning techniques to develop credit and market risk models. I am also actively involved in innovating and developing robust large-scale models in Epidemiology.

I am open to engaging in discussions about the role of Mathematics in Finance, Data Science and Epidemiology. If you want to discuss this, please get in touch with me on LinkedIn, Facebook, or Email. Thank you!
